- Add an option `--filter-position` to the `dafny verify` command. The option filters what gets verified based on a source location. The location is specified as a file path suffix, optionally followed by a colon and a line number. For example, `dafny verify dfyconfig.toml --filter-position=source1.dfy:5` will only verify things that range over line 5 in the file `source1.dfy`. In combination with ``--isolate-assertions`, individual assertions can be verified by filtering on the line that contains them. When processing a single file, the filename can be skipped, for example: `dafny verify MyFile.dfy --filter-position=:23`
 
- Add an option `--filter-symbol` to the `dafny verify` command, that only verifies symbols whose fully qualified contains the given argument. For example, `dafny verify dfyconfig.toml --filter-symbol=MyModule` will verify everything inside `MyModule`.
